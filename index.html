                   The Boxer is a medium-sized, short-haired breed of dog, developed in Germany. 
                   The coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn, brindled, or white, with or without white markings. 
                   Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, 
                   mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. 
                   The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser 
                   which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. 
                   The purpose of the crossbreeding was to increase the white color of the breed, 
                   and the necessity of producing thousands of dogs for one of the most popular breeds in the world. 
                   The Boxer is part of the Molosser group. This group is a category of solidly built, 
                   large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor, 
                   the large shepherd dog known as a Molossus. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.

                    Boxers with white markings covering more than one-third of their coat, conventionally called "white" Boxers,
                    are neither albino nor rare; approximately 20-25% of all Boxers born are white.

                    Boxers are a bright, energetic and playful breed and tend to be very good with children.
                    They are patient and spirited with children but also protective, making them a popular choice for families.
                    They are active, strong dogs that require adequate exercise to prevent boredom-associated behaviors 
                    such as chewing, digging, or licking. Boxers have earned a slight reputation of being "headstrong," 
                    which can be related to inappropriate obedience training.
